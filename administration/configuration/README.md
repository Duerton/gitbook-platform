# Configuration

Most part of the available configurations in Intelie Live can be applied at runtime, on the web administration interface.

Intelie Live gives to devops plenty of control of how it behaves, from the web interface to internals such as cache, queues and so on.

Only the configuration that is required for Live to start up, such as the configuration database parameters, are defined on a configuration file, [live.properties](live.properties.md).
