# Annotations

Plugin Annotations (available for download on [Intelie Live Marketplace](https://marketplace.intelie.com/artifact/plugin-annotations)) provides a framework to create annotations on data. Those annotations are also events, like any other piece of data in Intelie Live, yet modifiable.

The plugin also provides a default UI (a timeline that displays notes) implementation, containing the dashboard timeline and an example of a micro-form. Besides, it allows creating more types (pressure tests, activity log, auto analysis, among others) of annotations through the plugin.
