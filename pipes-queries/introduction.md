# Introduction

INTELIE Live heavily relies on [INTELIE Pipes](https://pipes.intelie.com/docs) to perform online and offline queries. Pipes is the default query provider used by Intelie Live to perform data analysis.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although INTELIE Pipes is provided built-in in Intelie Live, any user may perform queries using other query providers, such as SQL, or even write their own provider.
