### \[API] New backend API that exposes locale information



A new API is available to get the current locale, this information was already available at the frontend using the i18n library and now it's available on the backend for plugins using the following method:

```
live.web().getSystemLocale()
```

&#x20;The response can be:

* "en\_us"
* "pt\_br"
