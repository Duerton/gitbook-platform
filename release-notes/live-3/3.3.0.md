## Details

### Xrange chart

Xrange is a new pipes chart type.&#x20;

It can be used at any Time-Series widget as a new layer

The Xrange chart expects an event with:

```
number start
number end
string title
string color
```

The following query can be used as a starting point:

```
=> every 5 min
=> expand (wend()-1000*20 as start, 
           wend() as end, 
           'Some message' as title,
           'orange' as color) 
```

### Setting to disable storage cache

A new settings option was added to the **System and Display Settings.**

This new **Cache setting** can be used to configure a regular expression for event types that should **not** be cached&#x20;
