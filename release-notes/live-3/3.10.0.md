### Ability to change the position of each series in the widget header

![](../../.gitbook/assets/after-feature.gif)

This new feature allows the user to change the series order. This will affect the header, the legend, and the chart itself. As we can see at this gif, whenever the user changes the position of a series (curves, layer, etc...) using the drag-and-drop at the header, all the related information gets updated.&#x20;
