### Details

#### Dry run simulation before updating plugins

Live administration plugins page allow users to start, stop, download, delete and install any plugin. When installing a plugin, the user has the possibility of uploading:

* a single plugin
* multiple plugins
* .zip containing multiple plugins
* .zip containing a folder named "plugins", with multiple plugins inside it
* or even a non-plugin item (see [Improve UI of non-plugin items at the plugins admin page](3.32.0.md#improve-ui-of-non-plugin-items-at-the-plugins-admin-page))

It's also possible to perform bulk actions, by clicking on the checkbox on the left of the plugin name, and then selecting the action.

Since every Live plugin can depend on others plugins, optionally or not, some of these actions can have side effects, causing other plugins to become INVALID.

In order to prevent unexpected side effects, since Live 3.32.0, everytime a user stops, upgrades, downgrades, or deletes a plugin, Live will show a modal explaining what are the side effects.

In the image below, we have an example of stopping the plugin-liverig:

The second section shows all the plugins that may be affected. In the picture, we have:

* plugin-object-list-service: it depends on plugin-liverig directly, and it'll become invalid after the plugin-liverig is stops.
* plugin-test: depends on plugin-object-list-service, so it'll also become invalid.
* plugin-package-manager: it depends on plugin-liverig directly, but optionally. It'll not become invalid, but some of its functionalies may be missing after plugin-liverig stops.
* plugin-package-hello-world: this plugin depends on plugin-package-manger, which depends on plugin-liverig optionally. Because of this, it may be affected and have missing functionalities, but Live does not expect it to be invalid.

To better understand the dependency between the affected plugins, the user can open the sections "dependency" and "required by". For example, we can see that plugin-package-manager depends on plugin-liverig, as well as verifying the warning message that will appear after the plugin-liverig stops:

After analyzing the side effects, the user may choose to stop the plugin-liverig or cancel the action.

#### Improve the style of non-plugin items at the plugins admin page

We updated the style of non-plugin items inside the Live administration plugins page.
