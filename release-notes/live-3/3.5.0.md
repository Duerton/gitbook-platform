## Details

### Dashboard Performance Report

Live 3.5.0 has a few improvements on this feature that was introduced on Live 3.1.0. &#x20;

![Dashboard Performance Report example](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (127).png>)

The first improvement was a bug fixed. In previous versions, if a user without Edit Dashboard permission clicks in a link to edit the widget he/she would be redirected to an empty screen.&#x20;

Lives 3.5.0 removes the link if a given user doesn't have permission to Edit Dashboards

Starting on Live 3.5.0, this report will stay disabled until the dashboard is completely loaded&#x20;

The last improvement is related to the way it presents the data.&#x20;

![Time wihtout formating ](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (73).png>)

As demonstrated in the image above, any duration in the report was presented in ms in previous versions.&#x20;

Live 3.5.0 formats all durations presented in the Dashboard Performance Report

### Plugin admin page

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)

Live 3.5.0 introduces a consolidated report on the plugin admin page. This report contains plugin recommendations and lists all missing plugins.&#x20;

These recommendations are categorized into:&#x20;

* User experience
* Storage
* Operations&#x20;

A plugin is considered missing if it's not installed but it's required by another plugin. Is important to notice that this functionality will not check for different versions and the current state of a given plugin. Therefore, the version check for each plugin is still available:
