### Details

#### Don't allow downgrade some plugins

Now, plugins can add a metadata in their manifest to prevent unwanted downgrades. This metadata is named `downgradeLimitVersion`, and should be added inside pom.xml>configuration>archive>manifestEntries. Here is an example:

```
<configuration>
    <archive>
        <manifestEntries>
            <name>${project.artifactId}</name>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
            <build>${buildID}</build>
            <expectedLiveVersion>${live-api-version}</expectedLiveVersion>
            <author>Intelie</author>
            <entryPoint>net.intelie.live.plugins.annotations.Main</entryPoint>
            <requirePlugins>plugin-messenger, plugin-healthcheck;optional</requirePlugins>
            _<downgradeLimitVersion>3.6.0</downgradeLimitVersion>_
        </manifestEntries>
    </archive>
</configuration>
```

The  `downgradeLimitVersion` is displayed inside the "messages" tab, at the Live administration plugins page:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Downgrade limit version</p></figcaption></figure>

In this example, the version of plugin-test is 2.1.2, and it can only be downgraded until version 2.0.0. This means that a admin user can downgrade it to version 2.1.1, 2.1.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.0, but not to version 1.9.3, for example.

If the user tries to install version 1.9.3, Live will prevent the user, showing the following modal:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Live prevents the user from downgrading plugin-test to a version lower than the one defined at "downgrade limit version"</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Although It's possible to install plugins by moving them inside the live runtime/plugins folder, it's not possible to downgrade them. Therefore, the `downgradeLimitVersion` doesn't affect this case.
{% endhint %}
