## Details

### The main persistent queue can be configured through live.properties and UI

Previously, persistent queues were configurable through XML. In addition, the main queue could also be configured through the admin screen. In this way, the values used in the XML were always overwritten by the values configured through the UI.&#x20;

From now on, the size of the safe and fail queues can also be configured through the admin interface. The main, safe and fail queues are no longer configurable by XML. This allows the size of queues to be changed while Live is running. The default value for safe and fail queues was set to 100MB (the same default value used in XML). The previously configured values in the `live-properties.xml` must be migrated to the new fields on the Display and Settings page.
